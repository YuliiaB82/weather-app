### Weather-app

Online application for displaying the weather for your current location or any city in the world.
Made with HTML/CSS and JavaScript, using the Openweathermap API data. 
It was one of my first projects on my coding courses. 
You can also see the screenshot of it and I kindly invite you to follow the link, try the app to make decision of "what to whear?" a little bit easier)
